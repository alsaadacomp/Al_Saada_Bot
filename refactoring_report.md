# Refactoring and Bug Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-07-16

## 1. Summary

This report details the refactoring and bug fixes implemented to address the bot's unresponsiveness and align the project with its documentation.

## 2. Issues Addressed

*   **Monolithic Structure:** The bot's logic was previously contained in a single file, contradicting the project's documentation which called for a modular design.
*   **Lack of Command Handling:** The bot only responded to the `/start` command, making it appear unresponsive to other commands.
*   **No Database Integration:** The project was missing a database connection and ORM, despite being a core requirement from the documentation.

## 3. Implemented Fixes

*   **Modular Structure:** The project now has a `handlers` directory, with each command and callback in its own file (`start.py`, `menu.py`, `help.py`). This aligns with the documented architecture and improves maintainability.
*   **Command Dispatcher:** The `src/alsaada_bot/bot.py` file now acts as a central dispatcher, registering and managing all command handlers. This makes it easy to add new commands in the future.
*   **`/help` Command:** A `/help` command has been added to provide users with basic instructions.
*   **Database Placeholder:** A `database.py` file has been created to house the future database connection and ORM logic.

## 4. Next Steps

The bot should now be responsive to the `/start` and `/help` commands. The next steps in the project should focus on:

*   Implementing the database schema and connection in `database.py`.
*   Building out the functionality for each of the main menu items, creating new handlers as needed.
*   Adding more robust error handling and logging.
